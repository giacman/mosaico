                "text": "The international runways and the most stylish celebrities have already set the swimwear trends for summer 2025, oscillating between boldness and sophisticated minimalism, with a keen eye on sustainability. Among the must-have models, the one-piece swimsuits stand out with their timeless charm, revamped with strategic cut-outs, side draping, and sensual one-shoulder lines for those daring enough to add a touch of boldness. For those who prefer simplicity, there are striped, floral, and autumnal-toned one-pieces, such as chocolate brown. Equally sought after are the high-waisted bikinis, symbols of retro elegance and contemporary femininity, loved by style icons like Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski. Also making a comeback are tankinis, a chic alternative that combines comfort and glamour, ideal for those who can't decide between a bikini and a one-piece. Trendy colours range from vibrant shades like bright orange, lime green, and bubblegum pink to more delicate and natural tones like sand, terracotta, and olive green. Floral, tropical, and geometric prints, as well as stripes, nod to the '60s marinière look. Classic favourites like minimal black and optical white are essential for always-refined beachwear outfits.",

With their timeless appeal, these models return in style, reimagined with daring cut-out designs, sensual one-shoulder lines, high-cut '80s shapes, and minimal Olympic-inspired designs. Celebrities like Hailey Bieber and Kendall Jenner have made the one-piece swimsuit a versatile staple, perfect for both beach days and as an elegant evening bodysuit paired with jeans, palazzo pants, or high-waisted skirts. Iconic brands offer chic yet shaping swimsuits, like tankinis, a mix of one-piece and bikini, providing the advantage of enhancing the silhouette without sacrificing comfort. Among the coolest models are the draped ones by Zimmermann, which sculpt the silhouette, crinkle-textured seamless swimsuits by Eres, and minimalist designs in unique materials by Bond-Eye. The classic black one-piece swimsuit remains indispensable, refined and elegant, often adorned with asymmetrical white details or featuring a high, sporty neckline. Luxury brands like Moncler, Moschino, Max Mara, and Reina Olga are worth watching if you're seeking a luxurious and decidedly refined swimsuit. There are also vibrant models in bright red, orange, fuchsia, and lime, or those with floral, tropical, and asymmetrical prints. Finally, don't miss the one-piece swimsuit in sophisticated hues like warm brown or marinière stripes, a major trend for summer 2025.",

Symbolising effortless sensuality, the high-waisted bikini is back to conquer the beaches in women's swimwear fashion for 2025. Inspired by the looks of Bella Hadid and Emily Ratajkowski, these bikinis accentuate the waist and elongate the silhouette with high-cut bottoms and sporty or triangle tops. Thus, the iconic charm of the '90s once again captivates the hearts of glam enthusiasts. Among the most beloved brands are Matteau with minimal and sophisticated bikinis, Toteme with clean and essential lines, and Tropic of C, founded by model Candice Swanepoel, combining sustainability and glamour. The competition for the coolest swimsuit is played out between bright colours, vintage details, and clean silhouettes. In addition to the classic high-waisted bikinis, this summer also features minimal or ruched models with side drawstrings reminiscent of '50s style. Alongside classic colours like navy blue or blush pink, the runways present new vibrant shades like orange, lemon yellow, and emerald green, perfect for a season of cheer and fun. But there are also palettes in neutral tones like cream white, matte black, and delicate shades like sand, sage green, and taupe, ideal for timeless beach fashion.",

A fashion trend that continues to gain ground is the green ethos as a new form of luxury for summer 2025. Increasing environmental awareness and ethical production in fashion have led celebrities and influencers like Emma Watson, Gisele Bündchen, and Margot Robbie to consciously choose brands that respect the planet without sacrificing style. Materials like regenerated nylon ECONYL®, sourced from recovered fishing nets and ocean waste, certified organic cotton, and bamboo fibres characterise the most sought-after 'green' swimsuits. Emerging brands like Isole&Vulcani and Lido, with their minimal-shaped bikinis made from organic cotton and dyed with natural dyes, have created the perfect combo for those who love an essential yet chic style. A bolder and more innovative approach is dedicated to Bond-Eye and Reina Olga's swimsuits, offering sustainable bikinis with original and modern designs, proving that sustainability and trends can coexist perfectly. Then there's also the brand Chloé, whose swimwear lines embody the brand's refined elegance and environmental commitment. The collection features models made from eco-friendly materials, such as recycled polyamide and certified fabrics, ensuring style and comfort without compromising sustainability. Distinctive designs, like V-necks and cut-out details, combine with sophisticated tones, offering versatile options for every summer occasion. The palette of sustainable swimsuits is tinged with sophisticated colours: alongside the classic cream white and matte black are delicate shades like sand, sage green, and taupe, ideal for timeless beach fashion.",

In this case, the choice falls on a swimsuit capable of visually balancing the figure, tending to emphasise the more petite part of the body, namely the upper part. Among the most famous celebrities with this type of silhouette are Jennifer Lopez and Beyoncé. It's no coincidence that their swimsuit choices fall on strategic models that enhance the décolleté and slim the hips. Opt for bikinis with simple bottoms, perhaps in dark or neutral tones like black, navy blue, or dark green, paired with tops with ruffles, flounces, or floral and graphic patterns that enhance the upper body, such as the chest and shoulders. Zimmermann offers swimsuits with plunging tops, rich in floral details and ruffles, while Agua by Agua Bendita debuts with bikinis and tankinis with prints reminiscent of a romantic retro style. If you have a penchant for one-piece swimsuits, opt for one-shoulder models or those with wide necklines, ideal for creating a perfect visual balance.",

Shaping one-pieces or those with a deep neckline, such as models by Eres or Coperni, are fantastic for gently defining the waist, creating a slight slimming effect.

Among one-piece swimsuits, the choice falls on models with lateral or frontal cut-outs, such as the minimal-chic ones by Toteme, which create the optical illusion of curves in the right places.

Among the must-have models for an hourglass figure are high-waisted bikinis: with an elegant cut and a vintage feel, like those proposed by Magda Butrym, Agua by Agua Bendita, or Isole&Vulcani, whose captivating lines perfectly highlight the waist and provide a femininity with unique charm. Fans of one-piece swimsuits, on the other hand, enriched with modern details, have ample choice among models with belts or lateral cut-out details that boldly highlight this type of physique, emphasising harmonious proportions.
