## 🖼️ What You Should See

### 1. Visit: http://localhost:3000/dashboard

**If no projects exist:**
- Empty state with Mosaico icon
- "No Projects Yet" message
- "New Project" button

**If projects exist:**
- Grid of project cards
- Each card shows:
  - Project name
  - Brief (first 2 lines)
  - Component count
  - Language count
  - Last updated info
  - Edit/Delete menu (hover to see)

### 2. Try Creating a Project

1. Click "+ New Project" button
2. Enter name: "Spring Campaign 2025"
3. Enter brief: "Promote new handbag collection"
4. Click "Create Project"
5. You'll be redirected to `/dashboard/projects/1` (project editor - coming next!)

## 🔄 Data Flow

```
User Action (Frontend)
    ↓
Server Action (actions/projects.ts)
    ↓
Clerk Auth (Get JWT Token)
    ↓
Backend API (FastAPI on localhost:8080)
    ↓
PostgreSQL Database
    ↓
Response back to Frontend
    ↓
UI Update + Toast Notification
```

---

## 🐛 Known Issues (Expected)

1. **Project editor page doesn't exist yet** - You'll see a 404 when clicking a project card. This is expected! We'll build it next.

2. **Backend might not be running** - If you see "Failed to Load Projects", make sure your backend is running:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   source .venv-mosaico/bin/activate
   python -m app.main
   ```

## ✨ What's Next (Phase 2)

Now that the projects list is working, we need to build the **Project Editor** page where users can:

1. ✅ Edit project name and brief
2. 📝 Define email structure (Subject, Pre-header, Body, CTA)
3. 🖼️ Upload and assign images
4. 🎨 Select tone of voice
5. 🌍 Choose target languages
6. ✨ Generate content with AI
7. 🌐 Translate content
8. 📤 Export to Google Sheets

**Next file to create:**
- `app/(authenticated)/dashboard/projects/[id]/page.tsx` - Project editor page

---

## 🎊 Celebration Checkpoint!

You now have:
- ✅ A working Next.js dashboard
- ✅ Clerk authentication
- ✅ CRUD operations for projects
- ✅ Clean, modern UI
- ✅ Full-stack data flow

**From template to Mosaico in ~30 minutes!** 🚀
