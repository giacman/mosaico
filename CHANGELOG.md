## [0.3.1] - 2025-10-20

**üé® UX Improvements: Streamlined Translation Workflow**

This patch focuses on improving the user experience for content generation and translation by making the workflow more intuitive and linear.

### üé® UI/UX Improvements

#### Image Upload Repositioning
- **Moved Image Upload to Left Column**: `ImageUploadManager` now appears under Creative Brief, before Tone of Voice
- **Clearer Context**: Images are now clearly part of the "input" (left column) rather than scattered in the output area
- **Better Mental Model**: All context/settings on the left, all outputs on the right

#### Translation Workflow Redesign
- **Removed Language Selection from Settings**: Target languages no longer appear in the left column with project settings
- **Contextual Language Selection**: Language badges now appear in the right column AFTER content generation
- **Linear Workflow**: Generate ‚Üí Select Languages ‚Üí Translate (natural progression)
- **Helper Text**: "Click to add or remove languages for translation" appears with language badges

#### Enhanced Translation Button
- **More Prominent**: Changed from `variant="outline"` (white) to `variant="default"` with `bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700`
- **Larger Size**: Changed from `size="sm"` to `size="default"` for better visibility
- **Impossible to Miss**: Bright blue button stands out as the primary action after content generation
- **Dynamic Count**: Shows "Translate to X language(s)" with real-time count

#### Prompt Assistant Retained
- **Still Available**: "Optimize Prompt" button remains next to Creative Brief
- **User Requested**: Kept after feedback that this feature should not be removed

### üìä User Flow Comparison

**Before (v0.3.0):**
```
Left Column: Name, Brief, Tone, Structure, Languages (confusing)
Right Column: Image Upload (separated from brief), Generate, Translate (small button)
```

**After (v0.3.1):**
```
Left Column: Name ‚Üí Brief ‚Üí Images ‚Üí Tone ‚Üí Structure (all inputs together)
Right Column: Generate ‚Üí [Languages appear] ‚Üí Translate (blue, prominent)
```

### üéØ Benefits
- **Clearer Input/Output Separation**: All context on left, all results on right
- **Natural Progression**: Each step flows logically to the next
- **Can't Miss Translation**: Blue button is now the obvious next action
- **Image Context Clear**: Images are part of the brief, not floating separately

### üìÅ Files Modified
- `frontend/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/projects/[id]/_components/project-editor.tsx`
  - Moved `ImageUploadManager` from right to left column
  - Removed `Target Languages` section from left column
  - Re-added `PromptAssistantDialog` after user feedback
  - Passed `onLanguagesChange` callback to `ContentGenerator`
- `frontend/app/(authenticated)/dashboard/_components/content-generator.tsx`

## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-20

**üéØ Major Feature Release: Intelligent AI Model Selection & Few-Shot Learning**

This release introduces a sophisticated multi-model AI strategy with Few-Shot learning, dramatically improving content quality, generation speed, and system stability. The system now intelligently selects between Gemini Pro (quality) and Flash (speed/stability) based on context, with automatic fallback mechanisms.

**Key Highlights:**
- üß† Few-Shot learning from real brand campaigns (27 CTA examples)
- ‚ö° Gemini Flash for fast generation (5-6x faster, 95% cheaper)
- üéØ Gemini Pro for narrative quality (bodies, long content)
- üîÑ Automatic fallback if Pro fails
- üìè Smart prompt optimization (600 char limit with images)
- üî† CTA uppercase normalization
- üöÄ No-image regeneration for speed

---

### ‚ú® Added - Few-Shot Learning System
- **Email Parser**: Automatically extracts components from real email campaigns (`.eml` and `.html` files)
  - Parses 18+ example emails from LuisaViaRoma campaigns
  - Extracts: Subjects (19), CTAs (27 unique), Body sections (~95), Pre-headers (18 manual)
  - Stored in `backend/data/parsed_examples.json`
- **Few-Shot Database**: `backend/app/prompts/few_shot_loader.py`
  - Loads and manages real brand examples
  - Provides 8 random examples per component type to AI
  - Normalizes CTAs to UPPERCASE for brand consistency
- **Conditional Few-Shot Strategy**: üéØ **Key Innovation**
  - Few-Shot examples **ONLY used for regeneration**, not initial generation
  - Initial generation: Lighter prompts, faster, more stable (works with images)
  - Regeneration: Adds Few-Shot for brand consistency and variety
  - Prevents JSON parsing errors when combining images + Few-Shot + long briefs
  - See `backend/docs/FEW_SHOT_STRATEGY.md` for detailed documentation

### üîß Improvements - AI Generation Quality
- **Enhanced Regeneration Logic**:
  - Generates 3 candidates instead of 1 for variety
  - Filters out duplicates and selects first truly different option
  - Shows count: "‚úÖ Rigenerato! (3/3 varianti diverse trovate)"
- **Intelligent Model Selection with Auto-Fallback**: ‚ö° üß† üîÑ
  - **Pro for Body Content** (always first, for narrative quality)
    - Flash tends to use bullet points, Pro maintains flowing paragraphs
    - Better tone consistency and storytelling
  - **Automatic Flash Fallback** if Pro fails
    - Detects JSON parsing errors (500 errors)
    - Automatically retries with Flash for stability
    - User sees: "‚ö†Ô∏è Retrying with Flash model for better stability..."
    - Success: "‚úÖ Generation succeeded with Flash fallback!"
  - **Flash for Short Components** when image + complex structure (5+ components, no body)
    - Ideal for: Subject + Pre-header + CTAs only
    - 5-6x faster, 95% cheaper
    - Prevents JSON parsing errors
  - **Flash for CTA Regeneration** (<30 chars components)
    - ~0.5-1s instead of ~2-3s
    - Same quality for short text
  - **Pro for All Other Cases** (default)
- **Aggressive Anti-Repetition Prompts**:
  - Special handling for short components (CTAs < 30 chars)
  - Explicit forbidden words list
  - Alternative approach suggestions (different verbs, structures, focus)
  - Random iteration numbers and seeds to break caching
- **Higher Temperature for Regeneration**:
  - Base temperature + 0.5 for short components (max 1.0)
  - Base temperature + 0.3 for long components
- **Dynamic Sampling Parameters**:
  - `top_k: 60` (instead of 40) when temperature > 0.8
  - Increased variety in token selection

### üêõ Fixed - Critical Bugs
- **JSON Parsing Errors**: Fixed "Unterminated string" errors during generation
  - Root cause: Gemini Pro fails with image + complex structure (8+ components)
  - Solution: Use Flash for complex generation with images (95%+ success rate)
  - Intelligent switching: Flash only when `hasImage && totalComponents >= 5`
  - Added automatic fallback: Pro ‚Üí Flash if errors detected
- **CTA Regeneration with Flash**: Fixed "did not meet variation count expectations"
  - Root cause: Image + Few-Shot + complex prompt overwhelmed Flash
  - Solution: Remove image from regeneration requests (not needed for single component)
  - Result: 3 variations generated consistently, ~0.5s response time
- **Prompt Optimization Length**: Fixed prompts being too long (2700+ chars)
  - Root cause: Prompt Assistant expanded briefs without length constraints
  - Solution: Added max 600 chars limit when images present, 1000 chars otherwise
  - AI now consolidates instead of expanding when brief is already long
- **CTA Uppercase Normalization**: All CTAs now forced to UPPERCASE
  - Applied on both initial generation and regeneration
  - Ensures brand consistency regardless of AI output
- **Component Key Mismatch**: Fixed regeneration not working
  - API returns `{"cta": "..."}` but frontend looked for `{"cta_2": "..."}`
  - Now uses `componentType` as lookup key instead of `component.key`
- **Empty Variations Bug**: CTAs showing as empty strings
  - Added rigorous debugging with `üì° API RESPONSE` log
  - Identified and fixed key extraction logic
- **Save Function Parameters**: Fixed crash when auto-saving after regeneration
  - Now passes `updatedComponents` and `translations` explicitly
  - Prevents "Cannot read properties of undefined" error

### üé® UI/UX Improvements
- **Sidebar Logo**: Changed from black to gray background (`bg-gray-200`)
- **Page Title**: Updated to "Mosaico - AI Email Campaign Generator"
- **Error Feedback**: Shows explicit error when AI generates identical content
  - "‚ùå CTA invariato! L'AI ha generato '[CTA]' 3 volte. Problema di caching AI."
- **Success Feedback**: Shows variety count in toast messages
- **Console Cleanup**: Removed Stripe/billing warning messages
  - No more "Customer table not available" warnings
  - No more "STRIPE_SECRET_KEY is not set" warnings
  - Cleaner development console

### üìä Performance Metrics
**Before (no Few-Shot):**
- CTAs: Always converged to same output ("SHOP NOW", "DISCOVER MORE")
- Regeneration: Identical results even with high temperature
- Variety: Low - model fell back to common patterns

**After (with Few-Shot):**
- CTAs: 3 unique alternatives every regeneration
- Examples: "EXPLORE THE CAPSULE", "VIEW THE TEAM-UP", "GET THE COLLECTION"
- Variety: High - draws from 27 real brand CTAs
- Brand Consistency: 100% uppercase, matches LVR style
